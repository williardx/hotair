Must do
-------
~ Style UI for adding an event
X Tiles can overlap in an interesting way (or at least new tiles appear over old tiles)
X Event form opens on left/right depending on where tile is in calendar
- Input validation
- Truncate lines of long strings correctly in tile
- Handle narrow tiles
    - Truncate long text (show ellipsis)
    - Adjust font size down for narrower tiles
- Tap on event shows full event title (if it's hidden)
- Make calendar bilingual
- Handle case where user wants to add clouds and there are too many clouds already
- Figure out how to do China-friendly fonts
- Fill calendar with my own events / content
- Tiles have elevation/drop shadow over each other
- Favicon
- Deploy website

Nice to have
------------
- Make calendar tiling masonry more intuitive
- Browser compatibility with Safari
- Make calendar responsive
- Smooth transition in/out of calendar vs. sky
- Performance optimizations (prefer scale down)
- Users can see other users' input from around the world

Done
----
X Render previous user input on load
X Fix calendar so that tiles / calendar columns are aligned / centered
X Map tile calendar position to position in sky
X Improve tile placement so that the tiles form a reasonable grid
? Improve performance so that many tiles can be on the screen at once
X Remove objects when they go off screen
X Fix scale of calendar tiles vs. clouds
X Ability to create larger tiles
X Smooth transition for calendar being added to sky
X Smooth transition for calendar being removed from sky
X UI feedback for tapping buttons
X Ability to exit event form
X Draw tile on drag
X Preview text in calendar tile

--------------------------------------
X Scene starts with a sky
X There are already several clouds floating in the sky
X Tiles are being added to the scene and slowly transition into clouds
    - If there are new tiles in the database then we show those
    - Otherwise, we cycle through all tiles added by users
X Pushing plus button (or whatever other icon) takes user to calendar view
Calendar view shows a very cluttered calendar, all with tiles created from user input
X User can then push plus button to add their own tile
X After a short delay scene transitions back to the sky with their tile slowly transitioning into a cloud
