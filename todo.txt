- Render previous user input on load
- Figure out how/when transition will occur
- Fix calendar so that tiles / calendar columns are aligned / centered
- Improve tile placement so that the tiles form a reasonable grid / have nice overlap
- Improve performance so that many tiles can be on the screen at once
- Ability to create larger tiles
- Style UI for adding an event
- Clouds move at different speeds and in different directions
- Remove objects when they go off screen




--------------------------------------
X Scene starts with a sky
There are already several clouds floating in the sky
Tiles are being added to the scene and slowly transition into clouds
    - If there are new tiles in the database then we show those
    - Otherwise, we cycle through all tiles added by users
Pushing plus button (or whatever other icon) takes user to calendar view
Calendar view shows a very cluttered calendar, all with tiles created from user input
User can then push plus button to add their own tile
After a short delay scene transitions back to the sky with their tile slowly transitioning into a cloud
