--------------------------------------
X Scene starts with a sky
X There are already several clouds floating in the sky
Tiles are being added to the scene and slowly transition into clouds
    - If there are new tiles in the database then we show those
    - Otherwise, we cycle through all tiles added by users
X Pushing plus button (or whatever other icon) takes user to calendar view
Calendar view shows a very cluttered calendar, all with tiles created from user input
X User can then push plus button to add their own tile
X After a short delay scene transitions back to the sky with their tile slowly transitioning into a cloud
